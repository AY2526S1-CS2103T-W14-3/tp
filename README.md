# Furiends
Furiends is a simple contact-management app designed for NUS cat caretakers.  
![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)
It helps caretakers keep track of feeding duties, medical updates, and other important notes about campus cats.

## ðŸ‘¥ Target User Profile
Our primary users are **cat lovers, specifically individuals who are tasked to feed stray cats** who prefer to use a **desktop app**. These individuals are passionate about feeding and keeping track of animals around them.

They often have a large number of cats and other caretakers to keep track of. Information can come from various resources like face-to-face interactions, emails and phone calls, thus, managing these data can be time and energy consuming. 

Our **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is tailored for them to reduce errors, by providing a more efficient and organised way to store their data, allowing better care towards stray animals.

## ðŸŽ¯ Value Proposition
With the lack of such a platform present in NUS for individuals to consolidate their own personal records of the cats, information, and also the records of other similar caretakers on one platform. They currently rely on multiple telegram group chats which can be confusing.

Now with Furiends, **our target users can...**
