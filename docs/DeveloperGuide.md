## **Acknowledgements**

* This project is based on the [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* Libraries used: [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [JUnit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5)

* The undo/redo implementation was inspired by the proposed undo/redo feature in [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/), adapted to use a stack-based approach with `State` snapshots instead of the `VersionedAddressBook` pattern

* The UUID-based entity relationship design for managing Person-Animal-FeedingSession relationships was inspired by database design principles to avoid circular dependencies

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete person John`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete person Jack")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes (e.g. `AddPPersonCommandParser`) shown above to parse the specific user command directed at person/animal and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g.`ListCommand`, `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* All `XYZTypeCommand` inherit from their respective `XYZCommand` so that they can be treated similarly where possible

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelOverallClassDiagram.puml" width="500" />

The `Model` component manages three main entity types: Person, Animal, and FeedingSession.

* `AddressBook` contains three unique lists: `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueAnimalList`, and `UniqueFeedingSessionList`
* `ModelManager` maintains the `AddressBook` and manages undo/redo functionality with `undoStack` and `redoStack`

#### Person Model

<puml src="diagrams/ModelPersonClassDiagram.puml" />

The Person model stores:
* `UUID id` - Unique identifier for each person
* `Name name` - The person's name
* `Phone phone` - Contact phone number
* `Email email` - Email address
* `Set<Tag> tags` - Tags for categorization
* `Set<UUID> feedingSessionIds` - References to feeding sessions by UUID

#### Animal Model

<puml src="diagrams/ModelAnimalClassDiagram.puml" />

The Animal model stores:
* `UUID id` - Unique identifier for each animal
* `Name name` - The animal's name
* `Description description` - Details about the animal
* `Location location` - Where the animal is located
* `Set<Tag> tags` - Tags for categorization
* `Set<UUID> feedingSessionIds` - References to feeding sessions by UUID

#### FeedingSession Model

<puml src="diagrams/ModelFeedingSessionClassDiagram.puml" />

The FeedingSession model links Person and Animal entities:
* `UUID id` - Unique identifier for each feeding session
* `UUID animalId` - Reference to the Animal being fed
* `UUID personId` - Reference to the Person feeding
* `LocalDateTime dateTime` - When the feeding occurred
* `String notes` - Optional notes about the feeding

#### Undo/Redo Implementation

The `Model` component implements undo/redo functionality using two stacks that store snapshots of the address book state.

**The undo/redo mechanism stores:**
* `Stack<State> undoStack` - Stores previous address book states for undo operations
* `Stack<State> redoStack` - Stores undone states for redo operations
* Each `State` object contains a complete snapshot of the `AddressBook` at a particular point in time

<br>

**How Undo/Redo Works:**

1. **State Management**: Before any modifying command executes, it calls `Model#saveState()` which:
   * Pushes the current `AddressBook` state onto the `undoStack`
   * Clears the `redoStack` (executing a new command invalidates redo history)

<puml src="diagrams/ExecuteCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ExecuteCommandActivityDiagram" width="400" />

2. **Undo Operation**: When the user executes `undo`, the system:
   * Pushes the current state to `redoStack`
   * Pops the previous state from `undoStack`
   * Restores the address book to that previous state

<puml src="diagrams/UndoActivityDiagram.puml" alt="UndoActivityDiagram" width="400" />

3. **Redo Operation**: When the user executes `redo`, the system:
   * Pushes the current state to `undoStack`
   * Pops the next state from `redoStack`
   * Restores the address book to that next state

<puml src="diagrams/RedoActivityDiagram.puml" alt="RedoActivityDiagram" width="400" />

<br>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

Commands that modify the address book and thus support undo/redo:
* `add person` / `add animal` / `feed` - Add entities
* `edit person` / `edit animal` - Edit entities
* `delete person` / `delete animal` / `delete feed` - Delete entities
* `clear` - Clear all entries

Commands that do not modify the address book and thus do not support undo/redo:
* `list` - Lists all persons/animals
* `find` - Finds persons/animals
* `help` - Shows help information
* `exit` - Exits the application

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution (e.g., deleting a non-existent person), it will not call `Model#saveState()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `undoStack`.

</box>

#### How the Model Works

The `Model` component:

* **Stores address book data** in three unique lists:
  * `UniquePersonList` - Contains all Person objects
  * `UniqueAnimalList` - Contains all Animal objects
  * `UniqueFeedingSessionList` - Contains all FeedingSession objects

<br>

* **Maintains filtered views** of persons and animals:
  * Stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
  * Stores the currently 'selected' `Animal` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Animal>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

<br>

* **Uses UUID-based references** to link entities:
  * Person and Animal objects store `Set<UUID> feedingSessionIds` containing feeding session IDs
  * FeedingSession objects store `UUID animalId` and `UUID personId` referencing Person and Animal
  * This loose coupling allows for flexible relationships without circular dependencies

<br>

* **Stores user preferences** in a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.

<br>

* **Does not depend on other components** as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with corrupted data files

   1. To simulate a corrupted data file, remove the `id` field from one of the person entries in `addressbook.json` file located in the `data` folder where the `furiends.jar` file is located.
   2. The application will still launch, but no entries will be loaded.
   3. To solve this, delete the corrupted `addressbook.json` file and relaunch the application. 
   4. A new `addressbook.json` file is created with sample data.

2. Dealing with missing data files

   1. To simulate a missing data file, delete the `addressbook.json` file located in the `data` folder where the `furiends.jar` file is located.  
   2. To solve this, relaunch the application.  
   3. A new `addressbook.json` file is created with sample data.
